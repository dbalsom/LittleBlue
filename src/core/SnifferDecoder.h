    bool _bus_iochrdy;  // +I/O CH RDY I  I/O Channel Ready: This line, normally high (ready), is pulled low (not ready) by a memory or I/O device to lengthen I/O or memory cycles. It allows slower devices to attach to the I/O channel with a minimum of difficulty. Any slow device using this line should drive it low immediately upon detecting a valid address and a read or write command. This line should never be held low longer than 10 clock cycles. Machine cycles (I/O or memory) are extended by an integral number of CLK cycles (210 ns).

When this line is active (high), the DMA controller has control of the address bus, data bus, read command lines (memory and I/O), and the write command lines (memory and I/O).
